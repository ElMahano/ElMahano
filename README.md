- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElMahano
- 👀 I’m an AI enthusiast, especially machine learning algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my skills in programming and learning about data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects about robotics, and deep learning.
- 📫 my email: m.h.abaasi@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also an endurance runner. By running, I explore and I enjoy.
- Running taught me that consistency is the key to reaching my goals. Running made me
- comfortable with being uncomfortable, and most importantly, running taught me to never give up
- until reaching my goals.
